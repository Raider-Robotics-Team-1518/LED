# LED

Some of the LED "pixel" sketches we've been playing with. Some of these are examples from the FastLED library.

You'll need the FastLED library installed. We have found that installing it via the IDE was the only way to make it work. 

In the Arduino IDE, choose Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries. Then, search for and include FastLED.
